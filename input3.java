/*Mathematical Operations
You are given two positive integers. You have to calculate the result by 
performing +,-,*,/,% operations on them.

Input Format
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers A and B.

Output Format
The first line of the output should contain the sum of A and B.

The second line of the output should contain the difference of A and B.

The third line of the output should contain the product of A and B.

The fourth line of the output should contain the quotient of A divided by B.

The fifth line of the output should contain the remainder of A modulus by B.
